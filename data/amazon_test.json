The only reason I finished it was because I just need to see the ending. It was very slow, the best part of the book was the last 10 pages. It dragged it didn't really have a point.The best book Eric wrote was Cheaters. His newest books are not as good, they are in a way pointless. There were a few good moments, but nothing to make you cringe for more. You are better off borrowing this book.\n",

I like some of the songs (more specifically Outfly, Tara Lowe, J&R Project, Dee Dee, Kate Ryan, Hannah-Rose, LAAVA) which is the reason I put up with the other ones. For a \"trance\" CD, these song's are short and are okay if you're a radio-cut song addict. Not the best, but some songs are okay. Two stars. You earned every single one.\n",

I tied mine in a knot where I wanted it to stay. Works great, but manufacturer should change the, material. Would not be a good choice in Veterinary practices because it comes loose too easily and would put people in danger.\n",

    "input": "Title: Beginner's Camera\nText: This camera works very well for people who are just learning how to use digital media. It has a 5x digital zoom, but no optical zoom. This means that there is no lens to give a clear picture when the zoom is in effect. In other words, the pictures come out looking far away without zoom, and with zoom, they look blurry and pixely. However, I have gotten some excellent pictures from this camera since I got it in December. It's just difficult to take more advanced photos. I would definitely recommend this camera to a beginner, but for serious picture takers, get something else\n",

He buys a car but his plan is futile, which causes him to think that he needs a cabriolet in order to achieve his goal. This plan fails, which moves him to think that people who flie first class get to have what he so badly wants. However, he has run out of money and is in debt. This leads him to conspire to rob a bank and from this point on his troubles increase and it seems like he has lost focus on his goal.

I don't know much about reggae and after I did some research on it, and read a lot of reviews, I thought this would be a great introduction. I have not grown tired of listening to it! Most of the tunes are really great, they are classics, and I like all of the tunes. I only skip over a couple after I've been through the CD at least once (in one sitting) and want to hear some particular ones again. I do not hesitate to recommend this as an album. Only complaint is that Satta Massagana is too short!\n",

I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album. There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks, one after another. There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value, I still enjoy them to this day. Of course it's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One, Nas, King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.KEEPERS:East Coast/West Coast KillasBeen There, Done ThatStr8 GoneThrow the rest in the garbage and press delete.\n",

While this is a okay story, it is far from Nora Roberts best. I found the characters lacking, they seemed to be two-dimensional to me, more Nicholas than Morgan but not by much. At times I found my attention wandering from the book and had to get my focus back in on it, usually N.R.'s books' keep me riveted page by page. I think the main thing was that you didn't see how they fell in love, what made them love each other. You could see they had passion, but you didn't really get to know them all that much. The plot was good and it worked out nicely, I just wish there had better main characters, or at least they weren't so flat.\n",

Granted, the book is fiction but Meltzer has a few thank you's to WH insiders so I assume there is a bit of truth about security and what-not. As always the hip dialogue of 20-somethings arguing and joking is a lot of fun. Good stuff.\n",

There are several things to be learned from reading The Outsiders, one is that one should learn to understand, accept, and be kind to your enemies.
